## Installation
- Install the latest [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/download/v0.6.6/MelonLoader.Installer.exe) version to DesktopMate (v0.6.6 is the recommended one)
- Install .NET Runtime 6.0 from [Microsoft](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.36-windows-x64-installer) This is for MelonLoader to Work
- Download [Mesh Toggler.dll](https://github.com/SilverMoonDev/DesktopMate-Clothes-Toggler/releases/download/Stable/MeshToggler.dll) from here or Releases section on the right
- Your Browser might flag it, this is because this file is not usually downloaded, simply **Click your Downloads in the Browser and Keep the File**
- Move the DLL to the Mods Folder **in the Desktop Mate folder**

## Usage
- Initial startup of Desktop Mate will take a while as IL2CPP needs to decompile the game binary **Only on the first MelonLoader launch or after an update to the game**
- After that, press F1
- A Menu will open with all the clothes of the avatar that you have selected

## Notes for Development
- Make sure you have .NET Runtime 6.0 and .NET Desktop Support installed for Visual Studio
